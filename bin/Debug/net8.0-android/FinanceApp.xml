            This class has two primary functions:
            a. Manipulates database entries from the connected DatabaseLogic instance.
               Two collections are created within DatabaseLogic: a user-modifiable one and a copy of it.
               It compares these collections, generates lists of items for removal and addition, and modifies the database accordingly.
            b. Exchanges currency based on the selected radio button.
               A copy of FinanceData (the user-modifiable collection) is created in DatabaseLogic.
               The due amount of each transaction is converted to the desired currency without altering the original collection.
               The converted collection is displayed in the ListView instead of the original FinanceData.
